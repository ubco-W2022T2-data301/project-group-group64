## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

We hope to be able to identify the top Valorant players in the world and from their data be capable of determining who the best player is. Alongside this, we are aiming to see the correlations between the amount of time played in the game and the overall position in the world leaderboards. We have all played the game and enjoy it, but due to the nature of the game it has great statistical possiblities and should give us a wide variety of data to pull from and compare. As mentioned previously we would mainly like to see the correlation between the amount of time spent playing the game and how this relates to the position of the player on the world leaderboards. Yes! I think our dataset is diverse enough and has enough data to allow us to build such a dashboard, we would be able to add data such as percentage of kills from headshots, or time played daily as examples so I believe our dataset is very capable of building a dashboard.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The dataset was provided by user Ali Ibrahim on the website Kaggle who gathered, sorted and posted the data from the website tracker.gg. Our data consists of the region, name, tag, rating, damage_round, headshots, headshot_percent, aces, clutches, flawless, first_bloods, kills, deaths, assists, kd_ratio, kills_round, most_kills, score_round, wins, win_percent, agent_1, agent_2, agent_3, gun1_name, gun1_head, gun1_body, gun1_legs, gun1_kills (gun1 = most used gun) from the Valorant ranked leaderboard. The data was posted to Kaggle 9 months ago from Episode 4: Act 3 of Valorant which started on the 27th of April 2022 and ended the 6th of July 2022. The purpose of the dataset is for learning and fun. The reason why it is learning for learning is because knowing which gun, agents and the maps they use it the top ranked players use them on can allow players to learn which ones are best to use. It is also for fun since it is interesting and entertaining to find out the stats of the top players and what they use. Finally, the data was collected by Ali Ibrahim and two contributers Furkan Tokac and HarshJani4699. They used a scraper on the website tracker.gg on the ranked leaderboards to gather the data.

## Team Members

Tyler Cummings:
- The reason that I wish to work with this dataset is that I play Valorant competitively and am constantly trying to get better and improve my rank. I believe learning the stats of the top 500 Valorant players will allow me to learn which agents to play and what guns to use. The variables I am most interested in is the relationship between people's most used agent, most used gun, and their kills/wins as these might allow me to learn which characters are best and which guns are best.

Karam Hejazin:
- Gaming in general has been a huge time sink of mine, being able to play the game and then understand the top players of the games I play, is very cool, i am looking forward to seeing the whether aim determines their rank/winrate

Brandon Mack:
- I am interested in this topic as I have played a significant amount of time in this game as well as occasionally watching the esports events they host. I am most interested in the amount of kills compared to the amount of head shot kills as I am interested how often pro players are able to hit the head.
