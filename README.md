- We hope to be able to identify the top Valorant players in the world and from their data be capable of determining who the best player is. Alongside this, we are aiming to see the correlations between the amount of time played in the game and the overall position in the world leaderboards.
- We have all played the game and enjoy it, but due to the nature of the game it has great statistical possiblities and should give us a wide variety of data to pull from and compare.
- As mentioned previously we would mainly like to see the correlation between the amount of time spent playing the game and how this relates to the position of the player on the world leaderboards.
- Yes! I think our dataset is diverse enough and has enough data to allow us to build such a dashboard, we would be able to add data such as percentage of kills from headshots, or time played daily as examples so I believe our dataset is very capable of building a dashboard.
